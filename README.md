# ITEC301-Project

===> This website is only developed a a proof of concept and is not meant to be directly implemented as a live system. <===

This project was created for a 3rd year subject called: Internet Programming and E-Commerce.
The goal was to create a small scale e-commerce website from scratch using only PHP, JS, CSS, HTML, and a MySQL Database.

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone repo to you PC.
2. Install and open XAMPP and start the Apache & MySQL modules.
3. Go to the MySQL phpMyAdmin console and import the database file in the db folder called: cakeinc_db.sql
4. Copy the source project folder (ITEC301-Project) and paste it in the htdocs folder where XAMPP is installed. (Usually C:\xampp\htdocs).
5. Open your browser and enter the following url: http://localhost/ITEC301-Project/home.php

DONE!!

You should be able to register a new user and use the website as non-admin.

***If you want to see the additional page/information that an Administrator has access to, then:
1. Go to phpMyAdmin console.
2. Go to cakeinc_db >> users and locate you user record.
3. Change the admin column for you user from a 0 (false) to a 1 (true).
